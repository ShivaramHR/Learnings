# Learnings

This repository contains my structured practice work while building strong foundations in computer science, programming, and mathematics.

The goal is to focus on deep understanding rather than just completing assignments.

## Computer Science Foundations

### MIT 6.0001 – Introduction to Computer Science Using Python

Problem sets and implementations covering:

#### Areas Practiced
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)
- Function decomposition
- Boolean logic and validation
- String manipulation
- List mutation and state management
- Defensive programming
- Computational problem solving

---

## Mathematics for Machine Learning

Currently building foundations in:

#### Linear Algebra
- Vectors and vector operations
- Matrix fundamentals
- Geometric interpretation of transformations

#### Calculus
- Derivatives and rate of change
- Optimization intuition
- Mathematical reasoning

---

## Computational Thinking

Focus on:
- Encoding and validation logic
- Modeling real-world systems
- Abstraction and decomposition
- Designing rule-based systems
- Understanding state and behavior

---

More modules and structured practice work will be added progressively as I continue advancing through coursework and independent study.
