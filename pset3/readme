PSET 3 – DOCUMENT DISTANCE
===========================================================

Overview:
---------
This program computes the similarity between two text documents
based on word frequency.

Each document is:
    1. Loaded from a file
    2. Cleaned (lowercased and punctuation removed)
    3. Converted into a list of words
    4. Converted into a frequency dictionary
    5. Compared using a similarity formula

The similarity score returned is a float between 0 and 1:

    1.0  → Documents are identical
    0.0  → Documents share no common words


Similarity Formula:
-------------------
For each distinct word in either document:

    Let count1 = frequency in document 1
    Let count2 = frequency in document 2

    DIFF = sum of |count1 - count2|
    ALL  = sum of (count1 + count2)

    similarity = 1 - (DIFF / ALL)

If both documents are empty:
    similarity = 1.0


Program Structure:
------------------

1) load_file(filename)
   - Reads file contents
   - Removes punctuation
   - Converts text to lowercase
   - Returns cleaned string

2) text_to_list(input_text)
   - Splits cleaned string into list of words
   - Returns list of words

3) get_frequencies(input_iterable)
   - Builds dictionary mapping word → frequency
   - Returns frequency dictionary

4) calculate_similarity_score(freq_dict1, freq_dict2)
   - Computes similarity using formula
   - Returns similarity rounded to 2 decimal places


Data Flow:

Edge Cases:
-----------
- If both documents are empty → return 1.0
- If documents share no words → return 0.0
- Missing words are treated as frequency 0


Learning Goals:
---------------
- File handling
- String processing
- Dictionary frequency counting
- Set operations (union of keys)
- Translating math formulas into code
- Modular program design
